# Privacy Policy for HavenMC ToolBox

This Privacy Policy describes how HavenMC ToolBox ("the Extension") handles information.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

The Extension retrieves and displays the following data from the HavenMC server to provide its features:

* **Player Information:** MCIDs, skins, current world, and coordinates/location of players currently connected to HavenMC.
* **Server Status:** Total number of online players.

This information is fetched solely for the purpose of real-time display within the extension UI and is not used to identify individual users of the Extension.

## 2. Local Storage

The Extension uses `localStorage` on your device to store:

* User preferences (e.g., settings).
* Cached server data to improve performance.

This data remains on your local device and is never uploaded to our servers or shared with any third parties.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The Extension may communicate with third-party APIs (such as `api.mcstatus.io`) to fetch Minecraft server status. These services may receive your IP address as part of the standard technical process of a web request, but the Extension does not send any personal information to these services.

## 4. Data Retention

No personal data is collected or stored on any external database managed by the developer. All preference data is stored locally and can be cleared by the user at any time by uninstalling the extension or clearing browser data.

## 5. Contact
